  <h1>No Such Thing as the Right OS!</h1>

  <p>I am here to quickly dispel the myth that there is an objective &ldquo;best&rdquo; operating system.</p>
<p>If there were &ldquo;an ideal&rdquo; operating system, everyone would be using Arch Linux, obviously. Sadly, we are far from that reality&hellip;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my theory of operating system usage:</p>
<p>People use an OS that best fits their profession, practice, or prolivities. That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m an operating system relativist!
This realization came in a moment of unbounded rage that comes with devloping software anywhere <em>close</em> to a Micro**** system.
After failing at the task I had undertaken, I was watching some comforting Jonathen Blow content on youtube.com (shoutout Blow Fan).
I saw that Jonathen Blow was using Windows! How could any serious developer use Windows! It&rsquo;s proprietary barriers, convoluted APIs, low customizability, and bug filled feature updates all combine to make a development enviornment fit only for masochists.
But Jonathen Blow is cracked, right? He&rsquo;s a smart guy. So why did he use Windows?
Then it hit me, he&rsquo;s a game developer! Since Windows is the go to OS for gaming, J. Blow would want to test his code in the same enviornment of his end user. Huh.</p>
<p>At this point I will note that I am writing from the perspective of a developer / computer enjoyer. I don&rsquo;t know how this whole rule works for other crafts. Though I saw that James Lee Animations recently switched to Linux Mint. Pretty cool.</p>
<h3 id="the-other-oss">The Other OS&rsquo;s</h3>
<p>Now I know why anyone would develop software in a Windows enviornment, but what about Linux vs Mac? Why use one over the other.</p>
<p>I have noticed that all my friends with fancy software jobs all get Mac&rsquo;s for work machines.
Why is this? Why not just put some user friendly Linux distribution on a juiced up ThinkPad and call it a day?</p>
<p>I really don&rsquo;t have an answer, the hardware is powerful? And this leads the armies of React devs to write webpages with WAY too much javascript that runs fine on their $3000 macbook&rsquo;s but struggles to load for the common man?
I&rsquo;m pretty ignorant on this subject but this actually seems like a legitamite theory to me.
Send an email to <a href="mailto:will@willontech.com">will@willontech.com</a> if you have any insight.</p>
<p>Now, who is the kind of person that would use Linux? Finally, the good part.
The Linux user is a lone cowboy, standing on the edge between wild, untamed lands and civilization.
He sees extravagent cities, tall building stuffed with money but devoid of soul.</p>
<p>Wandering through the desert, starving and thirsty, he searches for something that might not be there.</p>
<p>He would rather die than give up his autonomy.</p>
<p>His Vim config file, his horse.</p>
<p>His shell scripts, the pistol on his hip.</p>
<p>His kernel, his heart.</p>
