  <p>The metallic clattering of the ladder against the plastic inside of my Honda Odyssey suddenly came to a stop.
I take in a big breath of air.
What have I been doing for the past 6 hours? Fixing computers &ndash; no, fixing a printer.</p>
<p>Wow. What a use of my talents! I got a computer science degree from UC Berkeley and I&rsquo;m using my knowledge of the dark magic of the 21st century to fix a printer? I could be writing the operating system on the most advanced copying machine the world has ever seen, but I spent the last 3 hours fixing a 10 year old printer.</p>
<p>And spending my energy trying to please <em>The Tyrant</em>! The guy has the managerial savvy of Nero. Not to mention the 4 foot stick up his ass. Should I, no, should ANYONE be spending time trying to avoid jostling an anally aggravating stick up someone else&rsquo;s ass?
I sent an email to the wrong client (the tip stabs right into his liver), &ldquo;THIS IS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL&rdquo;. I configured something incorrectly on a client&rsquo;s computer (some splinters get lodged into his lower intestine), &ldquo;YOU DID WHAT!?&rdquo;
Well I guess I was a good boy today, I got thumbs ups as reactions to some of my slack messages. Feels good to not be hated.</p>
<p>But NO!!! This is no way for me to spend my time. I went to UC BERKELEY for Christ&rsquo;s sake! I should be building the next groundbreaking, revolutionary software that&rsquo;s going to&hellip;</p>
<p>Eh, what&rsquo;s the point? Is any of this software good for the world? Has technology really improved our lives? Is it <em>natural</em>?
And do I even like coding? Delving into some autistic rabbit hole, digging around in the dirt in a world that doesn&rsquo;t receive a single hour of sunlight!
What kind of person would I be if I was better at talking to computers than to people?</p>
<p>Well, this has been a characteristaclly soul crushing encounter with the fork-scraping-against-a-plate-esque sound of the human mind that we call &ldquo;self awareness&rdquo;.
I&rsquo;m going back underwater. See you next week!</p>
