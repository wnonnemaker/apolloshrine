  <p>Welcome to Apollo&rsquo;s Shrine, a dedication to the god of music and logic.</p>
<p>I am coming off of a 2 hour Better Call Saul binge, and have to get this post out there in 10 minutes, as I have to leave for work.
To do that, I must upload the necessary files to my webserver, figure out how to make my nginx serve this hugo website, configure ssl, configure the DNS, and &hellip; I&rsquo;m now realizing &hellip; none of that is gonna happen.</p>
<p>I kinda wish I could just type my thoughts onto a page and have them magically done. This whole &ldquo;doing things in real life&rdquo; as a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; is really annoying. I wish to live in Plato&rsquo;s plane of forms. Maybe that&rsquo;s what heaven is like!</p>
<p>I am also finding that writing markdown blog articles using vim isn&rsquo;t that great, this program isn&rsquo;t infinitely powerful.
If I want to edit a line in a traditional word processor, it&rsquo;s easy. But in vim writing whole chunks of text and then finding the correct work is pretty tough.
Plus there&rsquo;s no spell check so I will never know whether I spell proccess, proffesor &hellip; other words with two sets of consonants that could potentially have two letters of each but there&rsquo;s no phonetic way to know for sure &hellip; it&rsquo;s tough out here.</p>
<p>I guess I could make some kind of macro that makes it easier, also add some spellcheck plugin. YOU JUST HAVENT CONFIGED HARD ENOUGH BRO. Exactly.</p>
<p>Anyway lets see how well this article renders on HTML, see you on the internet, zoomers!</p>
