I don't really believe in truth, but I do really like philosophy. 
This yields an awkward situation where all the writers I am reading are searching for something that I don't think they (or anyone) can ever find. 
The tension is ... tense

So what am I to do? What to make of all these truth seekers? What are those damn philosophers up to?
