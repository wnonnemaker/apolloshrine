Welcome to Apollo's Shrine, a dedication to the god of music and logic. 

I am coming off of a 2 hour Better Call Saul binge, and have to get this post out there in 10 minutes, as I have to leave for work. 
To do that, I must upload the necessary files to my webserver, figure out how to make my nginx serve this hugo website, configure ssl, configure the DNS, and ... I'm now realizing ... none of that is gonna happen.

I kinda wish I could just type my thoughts onto a page and have them magically done. This whole "doing things in real life" as a "proof of concept" is really annoying. I wish to live in Plato's plane of forms. Maybe that's what heaven is like!

I am also finding that writing markdown blog articles using vim isn't that great, this program isn't infinitely powerful. 
If I want to edit a line in a traditional word processor, it's easy. But in vim writing whole chunks of text and then finding the correct work is pretty tough. 
Plus there's no spell check so I will never know whether I spell proccess, proffesor ... other words with two sets of consonants that could potentially have two letters of each but there's no phonetic way to know for sure ... it's tough out here.

I guess I could make some kind of macro that makes it easier, also add some spellcheck plugin. YOU JUST HAVENT CONFIGED HARD ENOUGH BRO. Exactly.

Anyway lets see how well this article renders on HTML, see you on the internet, zoomers!
