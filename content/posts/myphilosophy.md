It is a beautiful cloudy day in Southern California, perfect for some writing...

In the field of ethics, there are two schools of thought that I find interesting. 
They are interesting because both of them go to considerable lengths to justify their own validity/practicality; so much so, that they end up getting away from the question of "how should we act?", and start moving towards the question of "is there any ground from which we can start answering the question of "how should we act?"". 
Answering this kind of question, thankfully, pulls us away from the trolley problem and the never ending discussion of extraneous edge cases that populate internet philosophy discourse that (as far as I can tell) sprouts from the lowly schools of consequentialism and utlitarianism.
Ok, I'll stop blathering and tell you what the two sides of this debate actually are ... drumroll please.

<span class = "centered-md" style = "color: deeppink">Humean Empiricism </span> vs. <span class = "centered-md" style="color: yellow"> Kantian Deontology </span>

If you aren't familiar with the four words I might as well have just made up, don't worry. They are only shorthand, points of reference for a general grouping of ideas that I (in my infinite generosity) will summarize for you right now!

I want my writing to be observational in the philosophical sense, *empirical* in nature.
When someone reads something that I write, they should be able to think to themselves, is that true? Could I reasonably see that to be true? If I were to write "Christian's shouldn't believe in God", many people would take issue with such a statement, and we would have no common ground.

I am a David Hume fanboy. To me, David Hume's greatest contribution to philosophy his criticism of the validity of should and ought statements. 
Without getting into too much detail (but *you* can get into said details <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4705/pg4705-images.html">here</a>), Hume was of the opinion that any statement of the form:

People *should* do ___ 

is impossible to prove -- one cannot say if it is objectively true or false.

I am certainly of a similar belief. So, saying that **everyone should always masturbate, every day**, is impossible to prove true or false.
And this is very important; if that statement is true, the morally correct state of the world would have an OnlyFans as big as Amazon.
If this statement is false, well, there probably wouldn't be any great loss, but there would be a large portion of gamers that appear to be doing the morally wrong thing. Why?

And try to prove, based on *a priori* principles, the previously bolded statement that I would prefer not totype again. I bet you would have a tough time! Even if you were able to prove it either way, you would still have to show why someone does or doesn't follow a statement that is "objectively true". The thing becomes a whole mess, a big ol' headache.

Thankfully, at least if you're willing to adopt my frame here, there is no way to prove these should statements. I was getting anxiety just thinking about the Kant-grade tome that I would have to write to disprove such a statement.

Hold on, if I can't prove that I should or shouldn't do something, then how will I know how to act? How will I change my behavior? Should is the basis for moral action! I for one want to be nice! It seems we have reached a contradiction...
### Resolving the Contradiction

I am now putting serious willpower into not doing a deep dive on the various logical directions you can take with the ideas presented in the previous section. I think you and I both will appreciate that.

If we can't make objective statements about what people should or shouldn't do, then we can never change our behavior for the better, scary!
If we are not going to make any objective statements about how humans should conduct their lives, then how will we stop doing things that are clearly bad for us: being a Nazi, stealing from grandmas, and playing League of Legends. 

That brings me to the overly-laboriously-arrived-to point of this article, which is that changing our behavior for the better can be done by giving yourself a more clear picture of reality. And *how* do we reach a clearer picture of reality, you ask? Through some good old fashioned observations!

### The Power of Observations
I believe, by my experience, by my *observation*, that I have progressively cultivated a more pleasent experience of life by consuming a clean diet of high quality observations. 
I try to *read* clear-cut, no BS observations. 
I try to *make* clear-cut no BS observations. 
Most importantly, I try to *remove* shadily-cut reeking-to-high-heaven-piles-of-bovine-feces "observations" from my brain.

The following is an observation about my experience removing a source of low quality observations from my life (a little observation-ception :) )
I used to do a lot of Reddit scrolling, telling myself it was for the sake of "keeping my knowledge current". 
One day, on a walk after some Reddit scrolling I make the following observation: "A lot of the news I read about Donald Trump has no tangible effect on my life". 
Notice I did not say, reading news about Donald Trump is bad, or Donald Trump is bad, or the news is bad, just that the things I read about The Big D in the news doesn't seem to affect me.
Now with this fresh hot observation bouncing around in my head, I return to land of wholesome memes. I then come across the most common type of front page post, the "news" story describing the weekly obscenity of Donald J Trump. My blood begins to boil, my nose turns bright red, smoke starts blowing out of my ears! I think to myself - why am I even getting angry? 
If anger is a reaction to an infringement on something that I believe to be mine, and Donald Newsâ„¢ doesn't affect anything in **my** life, therefore not affecting anything that is **mine**, then I have no reason to be angry.
I walk away from the screen -- calm, chadly, and free of any unnecessary anger.

### Dunking on the Kantians
Amazing! I have made a change in my life - I would even go as far as to say it was a good change. Plus, I didn't even have to use any should statements! Eat that, the categorical imperitave!

Contrast this with my should loving, *a priori* deducing, suit wearing ethics professor from college. 
During one of his office hours, the topic of depression came up. 
How can you account for depression in a Kantian framework. 
In his "everyone acts according to objective moral principles" framework, he was unable to come up with any good explanation for the phenomenon of depression outside of dismissing those with the affliction as being non-rational agents. Yea, get bent, David Foster Wallace!

The point being, an observation can *at the very least* account for the phenomena of reality (this is one of the largest weaknessess of the should statement), and you will always have a starting point.
Once I started making more observations and less moral proclomations, the question of how to act stopped being a question, it became more like a project, or a practice. 

### A Promise to the Reader
Given how much I felt I have benefitted from an observation style ethics, I have decided to stick to my principles and try to write as observationally as possible. One of the benefits of the internet and blogs is that you get to see the experiences of so many different kinds of people. The problem is that much of those experiences feel muddied by "takes". I don't want a nerd to tell me what he thinks the best browser is, I want him to tell me his experience with the various browsers out there, and I can decide for myself.

Anyway, hope you enjoyed! Stay tuned for more philisophically sober writing!
