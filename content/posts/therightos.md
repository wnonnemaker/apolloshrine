I am here to quickly dispel the myth that there is an objective "best" operating system.

If there were "an ideal" operating system, everyone would be using Arch Linux, obviously. Sadly, we are far from that reality...

Here's my theory of operating system usage:

People use an OS that best fits their profession, practice, or prolivities. That's right, I'm an operating system relativist!
This realization came in a moment of unbounded rage that comes with devloping software anywhere *close* to a Micro\*\*\*\* system. 
After failing at the task I had undertaken, I was watching some comforting Jonathen Blow content on youtube.com (shoutout Blow Fan).
I saw that Jonathen Blow was using Windows! How could any serious developer use Windows! It's proprietary barriers, convoluted APIs, low customizability, and bug filled feature updates all combine to make a development enviornment fit only for masochists.
But Jonathen Blow is cracked, right? He's a smart guy. So why did he use Windows?
Then it hit me, he's a game developer! Since Windows is the go to OS for gaming, J. Blow would want to test his code in the same enviornment of his end user. Huh. 

At this point I will note that I am writing from the perspective of a developer / computer enjoyer. I don't know how this whole rule works for other crafts. Though I saw that James Lee Animations recently switched to Linux Mint. Pretty cool.

### The Other OS's

Now I know why anyone would develop software in a Windows enviornment, but what about Linux vs Mac? Why use one over the other.

I have noticed that all my friends with fancy software jobs all get Mac's for work machines. 
Why is this? Why not just put some user friendly Linux distribution on a juiced up ThinkPad and call it a day?

I really don't have an answer, the hardware is powerful? And this leads the armies of React devs to write webpages with WAY too much javascript that runs fine on their $3000 macbook's but struggles to load for the common man? 
I'm pretty ignorant on this subject but this actually seems like a legitamite theory to me. 
Send an email to will@willontech.com if you have any insight. 

Now, who is the kind of person that would use Linux? Finally, the good part. 
The Linux user is a lone cowboy, standing on the edge between wild, untamed lands and civilization. 
He sees extravagent cities, tall building stuffed with money but devoid of soul. 

Wandering through the desert, starving and thirsty, he searches for something that might not be there.

He would rather die than give up his autonomy.

His Vim config file, his horse. 

His shell scripts, the pistol on his hip.

His kernel, his heart.
