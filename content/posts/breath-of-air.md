The metallic clattering of the ladder against the plastic inside of my Honda Odyssey suddenly came to a stop. 
I take in a big breath of air.
What have I been doing for the past 6 hours? Fixing computers -- no, fixing a printer. 

Wow. What a use of my talents! I got a computer science degree from UC Berkeley and I'm using my knowledge of the dark magic of the 21st century to fix a printer? I could be writing the operating system on the most advanced copying machine the world has ever seen, but I spent the last 3 hours fixing a 10 year old printer.

And spending my energy trying to please *The Tyrant*! The guy has the managerial savvy of Nero. Not to mention the 4 foot stick up his ass. Should I, no, should ANYONE be spending time trying to avoid jostling an anally aggravating stick up someone else's ass? 
I sent an email to the wrong client (the tip stabs right into his liver), "THIS IS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL". I configured something incorrectly on a client's computer (some splinters get lodged into his lower intestine), "YOU DID WHAT!?" 
Well I guess I was a good boy today, I got thumbs ups as reactions to some of my slack messages. Feels good to not be hated.

But NO!!! This is no way for me to spend my time. I went to UC BERKELEY for Christ's sake! I should be building the next groundbreaking, revolutionary software that's going to...

Eh, what's the point? Is any of this software good for the world? Has technology really improved our lives? Is it *natural*? 
And do I even like coding? Delving into some autistic rabbit hole, digging around in the dirt in a world that doesn't receive a single hour of sunlight! 
What kind of person would I be if I was better at talking to computers than to people? 

Well, this has been a characteristaclly soul crushing encounter with the fork-scraping-against-a-plate-esque sound of the human mind that we call "self awareness". 
I'm going back underwater. See you next week!
